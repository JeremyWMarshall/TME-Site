        <p2><strong>My Story</strong></p2><br>
        <p3>As a child, one of the first toys that I ever dismantled was my Power Rangers Zeo Red Battlezord. The toy was a small, red action figure with built-in motors allowing its arms to slide back and forth in a swift punching motion. Once solving the mystery of the toy’s inner workings, I became fascinated with how the motors functioned to move the action figure’s arms. Although my parents weren’t too thrilled, I loved dismantling my toys. However, as I grew, I learned that my curiosity was not limited to mechanics; it extended to other fields that would eventually challenge me to explore the expanse of my imagination in pursuit of creative ideas. <br><br>Through the years, I’ve had the pleasure of exploring engineering, digital design, video production, and human factors psychology, while using professional design tools to bring my ideas to life. My enriching experiences inevitably led me to the exciting field of User Experience Design. Today I'm delighted to use the knowledge I've gained from these diverse experiences as I continue to hone my skills as a UX Designer. I hope you enjoy navigating this site as much as I enjoyed creating it. </p3>
